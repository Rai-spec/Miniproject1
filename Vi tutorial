There are two modes when using vi:

Command Mode
Insert Mode

Press [ESC] twice to see which mode you are in. 

So to open vi textt editor, you just write vi and hit enter.

Press "I" and you will be in "Text Mode"

The main commands you want to learn so you can navigate easier in the document while in COMMAND MODE are:

k -> Move up one character
j -> Move down one character
h -> Move left one character
l -> Move right one character
w -> Move forward one word
b -> Move to the start of the word
e -> Move to the end of the word
^ -> Move to the beginning of the line
$ -> Move to the end of the line
x -> Delete a single character
dd -> Delete the entire current line
:x -> The colon followed by a number would position the cursor on the line represented by x
While in COMAND MODE, and you want to get in INSERT MODE, you can use the following:

i -> At the cursor
a -> After the cursor
I -> Before the current line
A -> After the current line
o -> Insert a new line after the current line
Then to save or quit, you need to get into COMMAND MODE, and use the following:

q -> Quit
q! -> Quit without saving changes
wq -> Write and quit (save and quit)
